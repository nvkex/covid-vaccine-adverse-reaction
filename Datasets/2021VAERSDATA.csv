He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient's Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient's tachycardia patient's Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily.

The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was 'hanging and drooping' and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as ""none"". Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn't speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine.

The subject's concurrent conditions included anxiety, acid reflux and morning sickness. The subject's past medications included Bonjesta (doxylamine succinate, pyridoxine hydrochloride) for morning sickness, nexium and famotidine both for acid reflux. The subject's concomitant medications included Dexilant (dexlansoprazole), cimetidine and sucralfate for acid reflux, citalopram from anxiety, Phenergan (promethazine) and Zofran (ondansetron) for morning sickness and prenatal plus DHA (vitamins nos, docosahexaenoic acid) for pregnancy.  The subject's obstetrical history included one previous pregnancy with one full term live birth. The subject had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation (MCM). The subject had no maternal or paternal medical history with MCM. The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 24-Jun-2020. The subject's estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 31-Mar-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 01-Apr-2021. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 25-Aug-2020, the ultrasound revealed no MCM.  On 02-Sep-2020, the counsyl chromosome 13, 18, 21 plus sex chromosome analysis and ultrasound revealed no MCM.  On 12-Oct-2020, at approximately 15 weeks of gestation (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration and anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100253284.

Urinalysis (UA) showed 3+ protein and urine protein to creatinine (UPCR) was 6.5.  Serum albumin was 1.5 g/dL (grams per deciliter), total cholesterol 465 mg/ dL, WBC (white blood cell) 6.79 K/mm (1000 per millimeter), hemoglobin (Hgb) 14.5 g/dL, platelets 417 K/mm, BUN (blood urea nitrogen) 20 mg/ dL, creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase ) 29 iU/L (International units per liter), ALT (Alanine Transaminase) 20 iU/L, C3 (complement component 3) 155 mg/dL and C4 29.3mg/dL. RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin), hepatitis B & C serologies, and ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) were negative. After approximately 2 weeks, UPCR worsened to 12 g/g.  The patient's past medical treatment included oral prednisone 1mg/kg (milligram per kilogram) daily, torsemide with 5mg/day and rosuvastatin with 5mg/day for MCD.  Complete remission of proteinuria was documented 2 weeks later and persisted after completing a 6-month course of prednisone.  The patient had no other significant medical or allergy history and no signs of systemic infection. She was normotensive and she denied recent infections or use of NSAID (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).  The patient's past vaccination(s), family history and concomitant medication were not reported.  The patient remained in complete remission until Oct-2016.  On an unknown date of Oct-2016, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer (batch number and other dosing details were not reported) for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date of 2016, the patient experienced serious relapse of MCD in the absence of other potential triggers of MCD(glomerulonephritis minimal lesion) with frothy urine (urine abnormality), periorbital edema (periorbital oedema) and her 24-hour protein urine was 1.5 gram (proteinuria), just after administration of INFLUENZA VACCINE. These events were assessed as medically significant.  The patients renal and hepatic chemistries were normal with creatinine 0.7 mg/dL except for serum albumin of 3.0 g/dL. UA showed protein 100 mg/dL.  The patient was treated with oral Prednisone 50mg/day from an unknown date of 2016.  The patient had recovered from proteinuria within 21 days after treatment with Prednisone and at the time of reporting, outcome was not reported for other events.   It was reported that, this case as well as previous anecdotal reports suggested that influenza vaccination and the resulting stimulation of the immune system may cause MCD.

He checked his pulse and noted that he had normal rhythm during the pulse check and at that time and he had Emergency medical technician (EMT) come over.

Patient was officially diagnosed with asthma in 2003. She said her asthma was controlled, and she takes a maintenance inhaler every day. She said she has been taking the same maintenance inhaler since she was first diagnosed with the asthma. She said she rarely uses a rescue inhaler. Reported she was prescribed the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg for her tachycardia that she had after her major surgery, but she did not take the full 25mg dose during that time. She said she hasn't had taken the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg in almost a year, clarifying it was last Jan2020 that she used the Metoprolol Tartrate. The patient previously received a flu shot in Oct2020, and felt rundown for a day afterwards, but that she always does after she receives a flu shot. She said she had no heart issues after receiving the flu shot in Oct2020. The patient who is a registered nurse reported she received the COVID-19 vaccine last night at work, on 29Dec2020, at 5:45PM, and had experienced some tachycardia after receiving the vaccine. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn't feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn't want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website's first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn't fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine.

Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn't have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn't know if it was later that day. She can't remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn't have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn't want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn't as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn't hurt as bad, but she can't remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She's been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don't give it to her anymore. She doesn't know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn't want to get the next one and have a worse reaction.

She was allergic to Sulfa drugs and would get shortness of breath, so they wanted her to wait 30 minutes for monitoring. She was feeling giddy on 30Dec2020, but she ran into a friend that she had not seen before quarantine, so they were talking. It was exciting. After her 30 minutes she went to her car and felt a little funny. She thought she was hungry so she ate half a banana and had some water. She had an appointment to get to so she started to drive off, and by the time she got to the interstate she was feeling funny. She got on her left side, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face on 30Dec2020. This was like the precursor. Then on 30Dec2020 her face started to go numb. It felt like a dental block you would get with Lidocaine. It went from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips. It was midline on the left side. She was breathing fine. She was trying to figure out if she should pull over or call(Number), but her airway did not close up. Her upper esophageal sphincter got tight and felt funny like she was going to throw up. She drove to the hospital close to her house which is affiliated with where she got the vaccine. She normally had primary tremors, small to where people do not notice. But her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs on 30Dec2020. She looked like a bobble head. But she could still breath. They took her right in and they did an EKG to make sure it was not her heart. Her blood pressure was up on 30Dec2020, she assumes for being stressed. They monitored her. They gave her Pepcid and Benadryl. She did not want any nausea medications. She stayed for about 2 hours and slept some from the Benadryl. Her face slowly became less numb. The numbness went away started from her lips and outward to her check and temple area. Then it just felt funny. When she touched it, which she never lost sensation, it was like, whose face is this? It was strange. She is not numb anymore. It took a while for it to go away, and it still felt weird. When she woke up this morning it was completely gone. She had recovered completely from all of these things. The only thing she has now was some transient nausea. It was very mild. It comes and goes. It had improved. She had not taken anything for it.  The events Feeling funny, her face started to go numb, upper esophageal sphincter got tight, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, were all assessed as Medically significant. The outcome of the event Nausea was recovering, the events Felt giddy, blood pressure was up, Stress was recovered on 31Dec2020, the other events were recovered on 30Dec2020.

Medical history included intermittent hives. Concomitant drug included ongoing cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) 5 mg for intermittent hives. The reporting nurse practitioner saw a patient on 31Dec2020 who was vaccinated on 21Dec2020 and had a Bell's Palsy reaction (reported as not serious). She did some research and saw no more incidents in the general population but she wanted to report this. She also wanted to get more information on if the patient should proceed with dose number 2 of the vaccine. The patient developed the Bell's Palsy within 5 minutes after getting the vaccine. She thought it was because she was anxious to get the vaccine, so she brushed it off. The Bell's Palsy was still occurring but per the patient it had improved. On exam she did not have any weakness, facial droop or dumbness with sharp or dull testing. The patient perceived it along the face still and the arm. The reporting nurse practitioner said that the arm was probably not Bell's Palsy, but more related to getting the vaccine in the arm and it hits a nerve. Patient stated that her smile was also unequal and it was difficult for her to close her right eye, although now (as of 31Dec2020) she can. Her right eye was irritated a little dry. Regarding treatment, the patient was started on steroids on 31Dec2020. She did not start her on an anti-viral as she did not want it to impact her immunity to the vaccine. The patient also complained of right sided ear pain. She was unsure if that was related to the Bell's Palsy, but it was also on the right side. There was fluid in the ear but no infection. The pain was still ongoing.  The patient also mentioned numbness in a small area of her tongue when she first got the vaccine. This was still ongoing. Outcome of Bell's Palsy was resolving. Outcome of the event numbness in a small area of her tongue, right sided ear pain was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.     The reporting nurse practitioner stated that this was not serious as this was a mild case and was thankfully resolving. The reporting nurse practitioner comment that nothing of history was relevant besides for the last several months (as of 31Dec2020) the patient had been taking 5mg of cetirizine hydrochloride for intermittent hives.

Discussion: Our case is unique in that the patient initially had anormal serum calcium level that had increased rapidly to over 22 mg/dl within a period of 24 hours, had no renal failure or any bone involvement; and had a normal quantitative serum light chain measurement. It is theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM (Multiple Myeloma). This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated (Interleukin), that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM (Multiple Myeloma).  This case involves a 65 years old female patient who had IgA (immunoglobulin)-kappa mm (multiple myeloma) (plasma cell myeloma), subjective myalgias (myalgia), severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia (hypercalcemia), persistent flu-like symptoms (influenza like illness) and proteinuria, after receiving vaccine INFLUENZA VACCINE.  Medical history, medical treatment(s), vaccination(s), concomitant medication(s) and family history were not provided.  On an unknown date, the patient received a dose of suspect INFLUENZA VACCINE produced by unknown manufacturer (lot number and expiration date not reported) via unknown route in unknown administration site for prophylactic vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient had severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia (hypercalcemia, non-serious), within a period of 24 hours after vaccination.  On an unknown date, the patient presented with serious subjective myalgias (myalgia) 5 days following vaccination and was hospitalized for this event.  Vital signs were stable. CBC (complete blood count) and BMP (basic Metabolic Panel) were unremarkable.  Serum calcium was 10.8 mg/dl.   The patient was discharged on supportive therapy.   On an unknown date, patient presented a day later with persistent flu-like symptoms (influenza like illness, non-serious event, latency unknown).   Laboratory revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl, normal renal function, total protein, albumin, ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) levels; clear UA (urine analysis) with no albuminuria; low PTH (parathyroid hormone) and 1, 25-(OH)2 (dihydroxy)-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated PTHrP (Parathyroid hormone-related protein) & viscosity levels.   On an unknown date, 24-hour urine collection of patient revealed non-serious proteinuria (550 mg), unknown latency following vaccination. Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. CT (computerized tomography) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy.   Quantitative immunoglobulins revealed elevated IgA (immunoglobulin A) (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG (immunoglobulin G) and IgM (immunoglobulin M) levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1.  On an unknown date, the patient's SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis ), UPEP (urine protein electrophoresis) and serum immunofixation test revealed serious IgA-Kappa MM (plasma cell myeloma, medically significant event, latency unknown).  Patient was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, pamidronate, and hemodialysis. Her calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl.   Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions.   Patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid.

A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn't know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn't have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn't seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn't have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn't given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender's Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

She said to wear arm sling and use Voltaren gel because I cannot tolerate NSAIDS. Following morning I had a virtual appointment with my primary care physician who said to minimize use of sling to avoid frozen shoulder, keep using Voltaren and ask physical therapist currently treating me for rehab post back surgery 6/2020 to add shoulder exercises, and let her know if still not better in 4 weeks at which time she would refer me to Physical Medicine specialist for nerve testing.

I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head.

I did not really read through the paperwork and was 'weird' sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday.

But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body's reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.""

The patient's concurrent conditions included multiple myeloma (MM). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient was vaccinated with influenza virus vaccine polyvalent (brand not specified; anatomical location, dose, route of administration and indication: not reported). The batch number was not reported.  On an unspecified date, 5 days after receiving influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, the patient presented with subjective myalgias lasting two days. Vital signs were stable, complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) were unremarkable and serum calcium was 10.8 mg/dl. The patient was discharged on supportive therapy.  On an unspecified date, the day later, the patient presented with persistent flu-like symptoms. Labs revealed serum calcium being above 22 mg/dl; normal renal function, total protein, albumin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels; clear urine analysis (UA) with no albuminuria; low parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1, 25-(OH)2-Vitamin D3 levels; elevated parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and viscosity levels. 24-hour urine collection revealed proteinuria (550 mg). Peripheral blood smear revealed rouleaux formation. Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed no obvious malignancy. Quantitative immunoglobulins (Ig) revealed elevated IgA (2415 mg/dl), and concurrent suppression of IgG and IgM levels. Quantitative serum light chain measurement revealed normal levels of kappa and lambda, with an elevated Kappa: Lambda ratio of 2:1. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electro-phoresis (UPEP) and serum immunofixation revealed IgA-Kappa MM. The patient developed severe-symptomatic hypercalcemia, she was treated with aggressive intravenous crystalloids, loop diuretics, calcitonin, Pamidronate (pamidronate disodium), and hemodialysis. The patient's calcium subsequently normalized to 10.1 mg/dl. Bone-marrow biopsy revealed intracytoplasmic kappa-restricted monoclonal plasma cells that occupied 40% of the marrow. Bone survey was negative for lytic lesions. The patient was started on bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and monthly zoledronic acid, and she has not attained remission from myeloma yet.  On an unknown date, the patient recovered from the event 'hypercalcemia'.  At the time of initial report, the patient had not recovered from 'multiple myeloma'.  The outcome of all the rest events was not reported.   The reporters assessed the event of 'cytokine storm' as related to the influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. It was theorized that the inactivated influenza vaccine given prior to presentation unmasked an atypical presentation of MM. This may be attributed to a vaccination induced cytokine storm, especially IL-6 mediated that may be the key in the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia related to MM. The reporter did not provide a causality assessment for other events.  The events of 'cytokine storm' and 'multiple myeloma' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.    Company comment: A 65-year-old female patient experienced cytokine storm, plasma cell myeloma, hypercalcemia and influenza like illness. Symptoms of the reported events started emerging one day after administration of influenza virus vaccine polyvalent. Very detail laboratory and diagnostic findings were provided in the report. Causality is assessed as possibly related for influenza like illness and for cytokine storm due to biological plausibility and presented information and unrelated for plasma cell myeloma due to biological and temporal implausibility. Hypercalcemia is more likely related to myeloma however the reporter's rationale points to vaccine as well, therefore assessed as unlikely related.

I felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When I looked in the mirror, I could quite noticeably see asymmetry in my face.

On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine.

Dad's reported that pt had a fever of 100.6 F (max temp) and hard stools. Pt was given a dose of Tylenol and 10-15 minutes later, pt vomited. Triage nurse advised that dad follow up with PCP office when open in the AM.  Dad called our office at 10:25am on 12/21/2020 stating that pt fever had lifted, but pt vomited a total of 5 times since the night before, with the last episode at 7:45 am on 12/21/2020. Pt had adequate fluid intake and urine output and stool had softened. MA advised continued home care. Appropriate triage advice was given and documented. At 16:43(pm) on 12/21/20, dad called back to clinic stating patient symptoms had worsened and they were at the emergency department. Dad disconnected call before speaking with the MA. The MA attempted to call dad back, but there was no answer. A message was left for dad to return call. On 12/22/20 at 12:44(pm), dad called in to clinic to report that pt had died- cause unknown. Our clinic obtained records from Hospital. The ED report stated that pt presented to the emergency department via EMS Code 3 in cardiac arrest. Unknown downtime prior to the initiation of chest compressions. Pt was staying with grandparents. When grandma went to wake pt from his nap, he was not responsive. When grandma tried to pick him up, there was possibly some brief, generalized seizure activity as well as coughing and gagging. Child remained unresponsive and was taken by private vehicle to outside Urgent Care where pt was found to be apneic and in asystole. An AED was applied, no shock advised. EMS was called and CPR was started. EMS placed an endotracheal tube and established IO access. 4 rounds of epinephrine were administered during the course of the prehospital resuscitation which was approximately 15-20 minutes. Presenting rhythm was asystole. No change in rhythm upon transport and arrival. Immediately upon arrival the pediatric transport team was activated and the pediatric intensivist was paged. Chest compressions were resumed according to protocol. Additional inter osseous access was established in the left proximal tibia. Fluid bolus was initiated. Serial doses of epinephrine were administered every 4 minutes throughout the resuscitation. The child also received several boluses of IV bicarb. Online consultation by ED physician with PICU attending was established early in the resuscitation course. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that the peds transport team would be dispatched urgently to the ED location in anticipation of possible ROSC and need for emergent transport to PICU. It was agreed by ED physician and PICU attending that transportation would not be initiated with the child still undergoing resuscitation requiring chest compressions prior to ROSC. Initially, endotracheal tube position felt to be acceptable based on the clinical evaluation, however chest x-ray did demonstrate some degree of right mainstem intubation, after which the tube was pulled back approx 2cm and subsequent x-ray showed the ETT tip in good position approx 1 cm above the carina.  Initial end-tidal CO2 was 14 on arrival, this continued to trend downward until undetectable throughout the course of the resuscitation. At no point were there palpable pulses or other evidence of return of circulation throughout the resuscitation. Capillary blood glucose was initially undetectable. The child received serial boluses of D 25 via IO line for a tital of 30 g dextrose after which CBG ultimately came up to 244. Multiple efforts were made throughout the resuscitation to achieve IV access and to obtain blood for laboratory studies. All efforts were unsuccessful, making it impossible to obtain any labs throughout the course of the resuscitation. Attempts to obtain even capillary blood samples via heel stick for CBG measurements were extremely difficult. Resuscitation continued for 49 minutes after ED arrival. A total of at least 65 minutes of CPR time. Bedside ultrasound was used to look for cardiac activity during the last 5 pulse checks of the resuscitation, demonstrating cardiac standstill. Despite the efforts and interventions mentioned, ROSC was never obtained and the code was discontinued at 17:03(pm). The child's parents were informed of his death upon their arrival to the ED at approximately 17:40(pm). Family was given time with the pt. The medical examiner arrived and discussed case at 19:11(pm). At 19:49(pm) Medical Examiner was interviewing grandparents along with 2 County Detectives. The medical examiner took custody of the pt at 21:52(pm). Evidence bag was sent with the medical examiner.  Pt received vaccinations 10 days prior to death.
