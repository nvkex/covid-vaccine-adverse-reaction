# COVID-19 Vaccination Adverse Reaction Analysis
VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System brought out through the 1986 act. In 2016 VAERS received 59,117 reports as follows: 432 deaths, 1,091 permanent disabilities, 4,132 hospitalisations, 10,284 emergency room visits, 59,117 total adverse events reported in 2016.

## Why is VAERS not working?

The most common reason given for not reporting is that the medical professionals havenâ€™t got the time. 
Those that cannot be bothered to report such an event should be penalized. How about someone in the medical fraternity taking this critical situation seriously. 
It beggars belief that this already set up source of surveillance on the effects of all vaccines, is not utilized to the utmost degree.
